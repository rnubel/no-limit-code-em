  %h2 Server API
  .well
    %p Your bot will communicate with our server through HTTP requests. There are only two requests you will need to make: 
    %ol
      %li
        %a{:href => '#check_status'} Check your status
      %li
        %a{:href => '#make_action'} Take an action
    %p 
      To test your bot's interaction with the API, see the 
      %a{:href => "#sandbox", :"data-toggle" => "tab"}
        Sandbox Testing 
      page. For an example round, see the new
      %a{:href => "#tips", :"data-toggle" => "tab"}
        Tips
      page. For some pseudocode to help see how everything should be structured, check out our
      %a{:href => "#example", :"data-toggle" => "tab"}
        Example bot
      \.

  %h2 Request Types
  .well
    %p There are 2 types of requests you will need to make to the server, GET and POST. If you aren't familiar with the terms, a GET request is the type of HTTP request your web browser makes to a server when you simply visit that page by typing in a URL. On the other hand, a POST request is the type of request made when you submit a web form. Consult your HTTP library-of-choice's documentation to see how to send a request of each type.

  %a{:name => 'check_status'}
  %h2
    Check your status:<br/>
    %strong GET 
    http://no-limit-code-em.com/api/players/PLAYER_KEY 
  .content
    %p Retrieves the current state of the game as seen by your player.
    Just pass your player key as part of the path. There are no querystring parameters for this request.

        %td How many chips you would have to put in to meet the previous player's bet. If no one else has bet, this is zero. If this amount is higher than your stack, then you can still <i>call</i> if you wish to go all-in.

                %strong Note:
                Actions like 'raise', 'call', and 'check' are all mapped to just
                'bet' with an amount of '0 for call and check. This should simplify 
                the logic in processing these actions, if you choose to do so.
