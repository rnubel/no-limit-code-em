  %h1 Sandbox Testing

%p.lead In order to make sure that you are sending the correct requests and receiving the correct information, you can use special Sandbox Testing routes.

%h3 Testing requests and actions
%p
  To test your bot, point it towards the endpoint:
  %pre
    http://nolimitcodeem.com/sandbox/players/SANDBOX_KEY
  (notice the /sandbox/ instead of /api/). Then, your bot will receive a state based on the value of the sandbox key.
%p
  To replicate each of the three main phases of a game, use each of these three keys.

%ul.list-group
  %li.list-group-item
    To simulate how the game would look after the initial deal, use
    %strong initial-deal-key
    as SANDBOX_KEY.
  %li.list-group-item
    To simulate how the game would look where you need to replace cards, use
    %strong replacement-stage-key
    as SANDBOX_KEY.
  %li.list-group-item
    To simulate how the game would look in the final betting phase, use
    %strong final-bet-key
    as SANDBOX_KEY.

%h3 Using the keys
%p
  You can use these keys in two different ways - both GET and POST. A GET will show what the game will look like if you were to ask for the game state during that time. A POST will return the game state and two additional parameters called "sandbox_result" and "validity". These will give you clues to see what you sent our server, and if it is a valid move or not.
%p
  GETs are made to the following URL:
  %pre
    http://nolimitcodeem.com/sandbox/players/SANDBOX_KEY
%p
  POSTs are made to the following URL:
  %pre
    http://nolimitcodeem.com/sandbox/players/SANDBOX_KEY/action
