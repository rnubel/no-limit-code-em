  %h1 Ante Progression

%p.lead In order to keep the tournament moving and wrap things up, the ante will increase as play goes on. Ante progression works as follows:

%ul.list-group
  %li.list-group-item The ante will be a certain percentage of the average chipstack of all active players in the tournament.
  %li.list-group-item 
    That percentage is determined by the following equation:
    %pre{:style => "margin-top: 5px;"}
      p = (0.08 / (1 + 100 * (e ^ (-10 * n)))) + 0.02 
    Where <strong>p</strong> is the percentage of the average chipstack, and <strong>n</strong> is the percentage of players knocked out.
  %li.list-group-item As players are eliminated, this percentage will rise until only two players remain.
  %li.list-group-item The ante will be rounded to the nearest 10.
